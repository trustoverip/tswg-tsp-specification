# Specification Template

This is the working area for the Trust over IP specification template.

* [Editor's Copy](https://trustoverip.github.io/specification-template/)

## Using this template

Two ways to use the template:
* The green `Use this template` button in the upper right. Then select `Create new repository` or
* When creating a new repository from the `Repository template` menu select `toip/specification-template`

After setting up your new repository you will need to configure GitHub pages.

Under `Settings -> Code and automation -> Pages` ensure the following settings are applied

* Build and deployment -> Source -> Deploy from a branch
* Build and deployment -> Branch -> gh-pages
* Build and deployment -> Branch -> folder -> / (root)

### Editing locally

In the root of the repository run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm run render` to render the HTML under `docs/index.html` this can then be previewed in your browser.

Run `npm run edit` to watch for changes and re-render the HTML.

Be sure to remove references to `specification-template` in favor of your new specification!
